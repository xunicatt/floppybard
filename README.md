# floppybard

A small Flappy Bird clone written in C99 using [SDL2](https://libsdl.org).  
Made for fun and to experiment with simple game development.  
The game supports dynamic scaling, allowing it to adapt to different window sizes.  

## What's working 
- Smooth scrolling pipes and base

## Requirements
- C compiler (GCC/Clang)
- [SDL2](https://libsdl.org)
- [SDL2_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
- [SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)

## Build
```sh
make run
```

## Assets
Assets are taken from [here](https://github.com/samuelcust/flappy-bird-assets.git).
